Pouch
===================


OpenSCAD source used to generate SVG cutfiles for a simple leather belt pouch that can be stitched together.

----------
Description
----------------

These files describe how to cut some leather to make a very simple belt pouch. I designed the pouch to be easy to stitch with a Quick-Stitch Sewing Awl or similar.

Files
-------------

All files come in OpenSCAD (.scad) and SVG (.svg) variants.
The object design is in OpenSCAD as four parts:

- body : this is the main body of the pouch. You need one of these in leather.
- sides : this is one of the sides of the pouch. **You need to cut two of these in leather**.
- loop-A : this is the base of the loop. *You should only cut one of these if you need it.*
- loop-B : this is the main belt loop. You need one of these, but may not need the other.

SVG is used by the GlowForge interface for cutting.
